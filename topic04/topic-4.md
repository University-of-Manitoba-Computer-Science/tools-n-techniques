Even though we're calling what we're doing here with version control "advanced",
we're really just barely scratching the surface. Nevertheless, you have a *more*
advanced view of version control software than making commits to a local
repository. You may not use all of these version control tools for your own
personal projects (I'm looking at you: branching and merging), but you will
eventually use all of these version control features in your courses and in the
workplace.

Importantly, though, you now have the ability to take repositories *with you*,
wherever you happen to be writing code. The addition of remote repositories also
gives you an alternative way to synchronize your code between computers (you
don't have to `scp`, you can `git pull`).

Finally, you've got some ability to use web-based issue tracking software to
keep track of the things that you need to do in a project.

You should now be able to:

::: outcomes

* [X] Clone an existing remote version control repository.
* [X] Push an existing local repository to a remote version control repository.
* [X] Use branching and merging with a version control repository.
* [X] Synchronize repositories between computers for a personal project.
* [X] Manage personal project tasks as issues using web-based issue tracking
  software.
