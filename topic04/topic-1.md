Now we can (safely!) make changes to code without destroying something that's
already working using version control. While using version control to manage our
own projects on our own work is useful in and of itself, it's not the only way
that we can use version control. Most of the time we actually want to use
version control with *other people*: either by working together on a project
with someone else, or by getting and using software that other people have made.

We're going to keep looking at version control, but we're going to switch to
taking a look at how we can manage projects: how can we organize the things that
we need to do for a project, how can we plan out how we're going to do a
project, and how do we work together with other people on a project?

::: outcomes

* [ ] Use branching and merging with a version control repository.
* [ ] Synchronize repositories between computers for a personal project (e.g.,
  `git push` and `git pull`).
* [ ] Manage personal project tasks as issues using web-based issue tracking
  software.
