<p>We have looked at using version control locally (i.e., using it on
the command-line on your own computer or in your own personal folders on
a shared computer system like the ones in Aviary). This week we’re going
to be spending some time looking at using version control software with
your web browser using GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p>One of the things that you’re going to quickly find out is that
there’s a lot of source code that’s published publicly on the internet.
Sometimes that source code is published (for example) as part of a
programming language. You can find <a
href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk">source code for the JDK</a> on
GitHub. You can find <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">source
code for Python</a> on GitHub. You can also find source code that <a
href="https://github.com/TheAlgorithms">implements many algorithms in a
variety of programming languages</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just because you can find these projects publicly
posted on GitHub doesn’t mean that you have been given permission to
include that code in the code you write that’s being assessed as part of
your university courses.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s a legal issue: the code that’s posted on web sites
like GitHub is copyrighted by the person who wrote the code. That person
may grant a broad open source license for other people to use their
code, but that doesn’t grant you permission to use that code in your own
code.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not it’s a legal issue, including source
code that’s not your own (you did not think about the solution, then
write it yourself) is an issue of academic integrity.</p>
<div class="aside">
<p>Source code is copyrighted, but may also be licensed. Some software
licenses are proprietary (you’re not allowed to re-use or re-publish
that source code in any way, shape, or form unless you pay for a
specific license); some software licenses are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open
source</a> (you’re allowed to re-use or re-publish that source code in
your own projects, provided you include the license); some are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a>
(you’re free to do whatever you want, however you want with the source
code and you’re not required to include the original license).</p>
<p>When you are in a position of licensing your software (which you may
not be right now!), a site like <a
href="https://choosealicense.com/">Choose an open source license</a> can
help you decide what kind of license you want to use when you publish
your source code for the world to use.</p>

<p>Academic misconduct is an issue that can affect you, and one that you
should take seriously.</p>
<p>The learning outcome in this topic is for you to identify whether or
not certain situations would be considered academic misconduct,
specifically in the context of Computer Science and software
development, so we’re going to show you some specific situations, give
you a chance to think about those situations, and then tell you about
why or why not something is considered academic misconduct.</p>
<h2 id="situations">Situations</h2>
<h3 id="situation-1">Situation 1</h3>
<p>Michael and Rob are both working on their assignment for COMP 1020.
Rob is having a bit of trouble, so asks Michael if they can talk for a
while on Discord about the assignment.</p>
<p>Michael and Rob work together on the assignment for a while, but
Michael never shows Rob any of his code. Michael and Rob only talk about
the assignment, make general design suggestions, or suggestions on which
data structures to use.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Have Michael and Rob committed academic misconduct?
</summary>
<p>No, Michael and Rob have not committed academic misconduct. Students
are permitted to generally discuss assignments that they are working
on.</p>
<p>The one caveat to this situation would be if the assignment itself
was to decide on what kind of data structure to use, but if this were a
general programming assignment, discussing data structures in and of
itself is not academic misconduct.</p>
</details>
<h3 id="situation-2">Situation 2</h3>
<p>John and Franklin are both working on their assignment for COMP 2140.
Franklin is really struggling with the assignment and asks John if they
can meet over Discord. Franklin and John both talk about the assignment
for a while, but John is starting to think that Franklin is really in
over his head.</p>
<p>John suggests that he share his code by screen sharing so that
Franklin can have a better idea about how to link together two nodes in
Java. Franklin agrees and reads John’s code. Franklin then writes his
own implementation.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Have John and Franklin committed academic misconduct?
</summary>
<p>Yes, John and Franklin have committed academic misconduct. When John
showed Franklin his source code, even though the intent wasn’t for
Franklin to copy the source code and Franklin <em>didn’t</em> copy the
source code, John and Franklin were participating in <a
href="https://umanitoba.ca/student-supports/academic-supports/academic-integrity#inappropriate-collaboration">inappropriate
collaboration</a> as soon as John showed Franklin his source code.</p>
</details>
<h3 id="situation-3">Situation 3</h3>
<p>Franklin and Heather are both working on their assignment for COMP
2160. Franklin is really stuck trying to figure out how the first part
of the assignment works. He asks Heather if they can meet on Discord,
but Heather is not available to help. Instead, she e-mails Franklin her
partial implementation that includes how she set up the assignment.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Have Franklin and Heather committed academic misconduct?
</summary>
<p>Yes, just like John and Franklin, Heather and Franklin are
participating in <a
href="https://umanitoba.ca/student-supports/academic-supports/academic-integrity#inappropriate-collaboration">inappropriate
collaboration</a>. In this case, since Heather is physically sending
Franklin a file, it feels a little bit more clear than just screen
sharing because sending a file by e-mail (or as an attachment in
whatever communication tool you’re using) is more tangible and permanent
than screen sharing.</p>
</details>
<h4 id="situation-3-a">Situation 3 (a)</h4>
<p>Franklin copies and pastes some of the code that Heather shared with
him, but he doesn’t tell Heather. Franklin submits that code as part of
his own assignment.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Have Franklin and Heather committed academic misconduct?
</summary>
<p>Yes. In fact, even though Franklin seems to be the only one doing
something wrong here, unfortunately Heather is also guilty of academic
misconduct because they are participating in <a
href="https://umanitoba.ca/student-supports/academic-supports/academic-integrity#inappropriate-collaboration">inappropriate
collaboration</a> together.</p>
</details>
<h3 id="situation-4">Situation 4</h3>
<p>Franklin is getting really desperate. He just can’t figure out how to
find the length of an array in C. While Franklin is looking for help on
the internet, he finds some code that looks <em>a lot</em> like it’s
supposed to be a solution for the assignment that he’s working on, and
may in fact be the sample solution provided by the instructor in
previous terms..</p>
<p>Franklin reads the code and it helps him figure out how to find the
length of an array in C. He doesn’t copy any code.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Has Franklin committed academic misconduct?
</summary>
<p>Yes. Similar to our first case with John, Franklin is participating
in <a
href="https://umanitoba.ca/student-supports/academic-supports/academic-integrity#inappropriate-collaboration">inappropriate
collaboration</a>, but that seems less obvious because there’s no other
person that’s directly involved in participating.</p>
<p>That said, there is technically another person who is participating
here: the person who originally posted the sample solution on the
internet. They’re <em>passively</em> involved in this misconduct, but
they are involved.</p>
</details>
<h4 id="situation-4-a">Situation 4 (a)</h4>
<p>Franklin copies and pastes a small fragment of the code that was in
the file he found (maybe a single function).</p>
<details>
<summary>
Has Franklin committed academic misconduct?
</summary>
<p>Yes, this is definitely misconduct and it’s significantly clearer
than the last couple of cases because Franklin is explicitly using and
submitting work that he did not create for assessment. This is an
example of <a
href="https://umanitoba.ca/student-supports/academic-supports/academic-integrity#plagiarism">plagiarism</a>.</p>
</details>
<h4 id="situation-4-b">Situation 4 (b)</h4>
<p>Franklin submits the entire file he found with enough modifications
to satisfy the current assignment description.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Has Franklin committed academic misconduct?
</summary>
<p>Just like the last example, by submitting work that is not his own
and he is committing <a
href="https://umanitoba.ca/student-supports/academic-supports/academic-integrity#plagiarism">plagiarism</a>.</p>
</details>
<h3 id="situation-5">Situation 5</h3>
<p>Franklin managed to get the assignment done for COMP 3430 (barely),
and he handed it in at the very last second. In his rush to hand in the
assignment, he forgot to include a part of the report that was listed in
the assignment requirements section. This part of the report isn’t
itself essential for the code to work, but is essential to help confirm
the results/conclusions that Franklin is writing about in the
report.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Has Franklin committed academic misconduct?
</summary>
<p>No, Franklin has not committed academic misconduct. Franklin has not
plagiarized any work, has not collaborated inappropriately with any of
his peers, and did not commit <a
href="https://umanitoba.ca/student-supports/academic-supports/academic-integrity#academic-fraud">academic
fraud</a> (he did not make up the results).</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Would Franklin be at risk of being accused of academic misconduct?
</summary>
<p>Maybe. In this specific case, Franklin appears at first glance to
have committed academic fraud, and it might be reasonable for Franklin’s
instructor to assume that Franklin has committed academic fraud.</p>
<p>If Franklin’s submission is identified as a possible case of academic
misconduct due to academic fraud, Franklin’s instructor might reach out
to him and ask for clarification or for the evidence that’s missing, and
the issue would be resolved.</p>
<p>If Franklin’s instructor still believes that Franklin committed
academic misconduct, the instructor would forward the case to the
Associate Head (AH) of Computer Science for Student Experience. The AH
would then act as an independent third party in the case and conduct an
investigation, including giving Franklin an opportunity to discuss the
situation. The AH would render a decision about the situation (this is
or is not a case of academic misconduct), and share that decision with
both Franklin and Franklin’s instructor.</p>
</details>
<div class="notes">
<p>Some additional scenarios to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Franklin’s instructor has given some code in the assignment.</li>
<li>Franklin’s instructor has pointed Franklin at a web site that has
code on it.</li>
<li>Franklin posts his code on GitHub (privately).
<ul>
<li>Nobody finds it.</li>
<li>Somebody finds it and uses it..</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
