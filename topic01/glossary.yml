      "text" and "plain text" mean that you can write things down entirely with
      the characters on your keyboard.  "text" and "plain text" are ways for us
      to describe a file that has *just* text --- in other words, just letters,
      numbers, and symbols that don't have any extra information about (for
      example) being bold, italics, paragraphs, headings, etc.

      Structured text is (+text) that gives special meaning to some characters.
      For example, in Markdown, putting the symbol `#` at the beginning of a
      line means that this is a top level heading or title for what you're
      writing. This is instead of clicking on (for example) the "Heading 1"
      style in Microsoft Word.

      A format is an agreed upon way for us to write things down so that other
      people understand what that means, or an agreed upon shape and size of a
      physical thing. For example, physical objects like paper have formats in
      the form of size, like A4, letter, or legal size paper. Microsoft Word or
      PDF are document formats. Formats can also be (+text) formats, where we 
      agree upon the meaning of certain symbols. See also (+structured-text).
