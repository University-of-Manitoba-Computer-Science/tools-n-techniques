First things first: we're going to get ourselves set up and organized:

1. We're going to install some software on our machines that we will be using
   throughout the course.
2. We'll use the tools that you can use for editing text and transforming it
   into other formats, and
3. We'll look at some strategies that you can use to organize your files.

You may be doing a lot of programming in [COMP 1010] (or [COMP 1012]) and [COMP
1020], but you're also going to be expected to do a lot of *writing* in computer
science. In some cases that's going to be to describe how someone else should
run your work. In some cases your writing is going to *be* the work. In some
cases you're going to be writing to communicate with your peers and teammates
(both in school and in the workplace).

In this topic, we will be looking at [Markdown] and $\LaTeX$ for writing
structured text, a tool called [Pandoc] for sharing and distributing that
text in formats like PDF and Word, getting you set up with [VS Code], and trying
to establish some practices for organizing your files into a folder structure.

::: outcomes

* [ ] Install software on your personal computer (e.g., `pandoc` and VS Code).
* [ ] Write plain text documents (including code and formulas) using structured
  markup formats (Markdown and $\LaTeX$).
* [ ] Convert plain text documents to different formats (e.g., `docx`).
* [ ] Define your own strategy for organizing your files.
* [ ] Build a directory structure with a visual file explorer for the purpose of
  organizing your files.
