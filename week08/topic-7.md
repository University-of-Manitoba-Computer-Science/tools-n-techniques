Summary
=======

Programs crash. They crash all the time. *Sometimes* it's easy to figure out
why a program is crashing, but your programs will quickly get too big for 
someone to glance at and definitively say "That's where the problem is!" (even
for you, the person writing the program).

Uncovering the flow of how your program got into a specific state is the whole
goal of debugging, whether you're using a pencil and paper, or using a tool
like `lldb`.

You should now be able to:

::: outcomes

* [X] Describe what debugging allows you to observe about a running program.
* [X] Use log-based debugging to identify a problem with code.
* [X] Use a visual debugger to set breakpoints, inspect values, step through a
  running program, and make observations about a program when it crashes.
* [X] Use a command-line debugger to set breakpoints, inspect values, step
  through a running program, and make observations about a program when it
  crashes.

Now you should be ready to start working on the assignment this week!
