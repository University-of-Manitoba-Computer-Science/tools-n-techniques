Introduction
============

Now we can (safely!) make changes to code without destroying something that's
already working using version control. While using version control to manage our
own projects on our own machine is useful, it's not the only way that we can use
version control. Most of the time we actually want to use version control with
*remotes*; interacting with repositories that primarily live on remote systems.

We're going to keep looking at version control this week, but we're going to
switch to including our web browser as a tool for interacting with our
repositories.

Part of what we're doing to do with this version control software is begin to
take a look at how we can manage projects: how can we organize the things that
we need to do for a project, how can we plan out how we're going to do a
project, and how do we work together with other people on a project?

By the end of this week you should be able to:

* [ ] Clone an existing remote version control repository.
* [ ] Create a new remote version control repository.
* [ ] Push an existing local repository to a remote version control repository.
* [ ] Use branching and merging with a version control repository.
* [ ] Synchronize repositories between computers for a personal project.
* [ ] Manage personal project tasks as issues using web-based issue tracking
  software.
