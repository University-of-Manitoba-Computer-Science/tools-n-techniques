Summary
=======

You've probably been told about academic misconduct in the past. Hopefully
seeing some examples of situations tailored to your experience in computer
science courses has given you the ability to distinguish between being helpful,
working together with permission, and academic misconduct.

Even though we're calling what we're doing this week with version control
"advanced", we're really just barely scratching the surface. Nevertheless,
you have a *more* advanced view of version control software than making commits
to a local repository. You may not use all of these version control tools for
your own personal projects (I'm looking at you, branching and merging), but you
will eventually use all of these version control features in your courses and in
the workplace.

Importantly, though, you now have the ability to take repositories *with you*,
wherever you happen to be writing code. The addition of remote repositories also
gives you an alternative way to synchronize your code between computers (you
don't have to `scp`, you can `git pull`).

Finally, you've got some ability to use web-based issue tracking software to
keep track of the things that you need to do in a project.

You should now be able to:

::: outcomes

* [X] Identify whether or not a situation is considered academic misconduct.
* [X] Clone an existing remote version control repository.
* [X] Create a new remote version control repository.
* [X] Push an existing local repository to a remote version control repository.
* [X] Use branching and merging with a version control repository.
* [X] Synchronize repositories between computers for a personal project.
* [X] Manage personal project tasks as issues using web-based issue tracking
  software.

Now you should be ready to start working on the assignment this week!
