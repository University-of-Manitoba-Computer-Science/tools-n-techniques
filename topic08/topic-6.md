::: outcomes

* [X] Install and configure software to back up your files to a remote server.

:::

Many of you already have OneDrive installed. Many of you already have Dropbox
installed. These are reasonable tools for backing up your data.

If you haven't installed one of those tools already, then you should do it now!

... what should you pick?

* [OneDrive]
    * OneDrive only works on macOS or Windows (or Android or iOS). If you're
      running Linux, you're out of luck.
    * OneDrive with your UManitoba student account gets you 1TB of space for
      free.
* [Dropbox]
    * Dropbox works on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
    * [Dropbox Free] gives you 2GB of space for free.

[Dropbox Free]: https://www.dropbox.com/basic

These tools are generally straightforward to install, and will back up your
files to a remote server.

::: challenge
