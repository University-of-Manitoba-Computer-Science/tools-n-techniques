Introduction
============

We've been *using* the command line, at least a little bit, throughout the
course. Despite its simple appearance, the command line is an incredibly rich
and diverse environment, and lets you compose really complex commands that would
be difficult to do with the visual desktop tools that you have at your disposal
right now.

We'll spend some time looking at how to use our shells effectively, and we'll
look at how to build up pipelines of programs to accomplish complex tasks. We'll
also be spending some time documenting how we accomplished those complex tasks
with shell scripting.

By the end of this week you should be able to:

* [ ] Redirect the output from a program to a file.
* [ ] Redirect a file to be the input for a program.
* [ ] Send data between programs using a pipe.
* [ ] Write and run shell scripts to repeat complex tasks.
