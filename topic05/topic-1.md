Introduction
============

Version control is an amazing tool. It's overwhelming now, but you're going to
be using this extensively both in school and when you get into industry.

We'll keep using version control throughout this course, but, for now, we're
going to move on.

This week we're going to be spending some quality time with our shells :shell:.
That plain-text interface seems to be both intimidating and primitive all at the
same time. Yes, shells can be intimidating, but we can do pretty powerful things
with shells that might otherwise seem magical to someone who's never written a
program before.

"But I can just write a program to do that!" I'll hear you thinking in class.
Yeah, you can write a program to do stuff like we're going to see, but *why
would you write a program that already exists?*

By the end of this week you should be able to:

* [ ] Find files on the command line by name using patterns.
    * [ ] Execute commands on the files that match the pattern.
* [ ] Filter lines from large text files using patterns.
* [ ] Read and change permissions on files.
* [ ] Compare plain text files.
