Introduction
============

So far in the course we've been using someone else's Linux system: the CS
department's Linux systems, pre-configured virtual machines, and servers that
are deployed with complete operating system images.

While it's great to be able to use those pre-existing systems, we really want to
be able to do this for ourselves.

This week (our last week!) we're going to spend some time looking at the
different kinds of Linux distributions that we can choose from, install a Linux
distribution in either a virtual machine environment or (if you're adventurous!)
on your own machine.

Then we'll look at how you can install packages on the command line, including
how to set up a web server.

::: outcomes

* [ ] Choose a Linux distribution.
* [ ] Install the Linux distribution either on your laptop or in a virtual machine.
* [ ] Install packages using a package manager on the command line.
    * [ ] Install packages using a GUI package manager.
* [ ] Configure and run a web server.
