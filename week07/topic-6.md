Summary
=======

The bulk of what we've looked at this week is about getting help, and
in terms of the way that you as a student spend your time, emphasizing this
topic seems like the right choice. While you still might default to using web
searching to find answers to the questions that you have, hopefully you've both
learned some new skills for how to do web searching (like limiting results to
certain sites with the `site:` option), but also realized just how much the help
you can get on the command line in the manual pages, even if they are hard to
parse.

You've probably been told about academic misconduct in the past. Hopefully
seeing some examples of situations tailored to your experience in computer
science courses has given you the ability to distinguish between being helpful,
working together with permission, and academic misconduct.

You should now be able to:

::: outcomes

* [X] Get help about a command by running the command.
* [X] Get help about a command by reading manual pages.
* [X] Find and assess the quality of help online.
* [X] Identify whether or not a situation is considered academic misconduct.
* [X] Use a web-based interactive notebook to document progress in a lab
  notebook.

Now you should be ready to start working on the assignment this week!
