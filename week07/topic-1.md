Introduction
============

We've made our lives a *tiny* bit easier by automating tasks with our shell,
like running commands on files automatically using `find`, and we've got a
better handle on how to use the command line. But *yeesh*, there are **so many**
programs to use on the command line. And every program seems to be different in
terms of how you actually use it! How am I supposed to remember all this stuff?!

Some people maybe do, but I don't. This week we're going to spend some time
getting help from various places:

* The programs themselves (short, but helpful),
* Offline documentation about the programs (comprehensive and correct, but
  sometimes inscrutable), and
* Online (overwhelming, and sometimes wrong).

This week we'll also (temporarily?) switch where we do our lab books: we'll
migrate from text editors to the web browser and look at digital notebooks,
where we can combine both text and code into one structured place so that we can
simultaneously document and explore code.

By the end of this week you should be able to:

* [ ] Get help about a command by running the command.
* [ ] Get help about a command by reading manual pages.
* [ ] Find and assess the quality of help online.
* [ ] Use a web-based interactive notebook to document progress in a lab
  notebook.
