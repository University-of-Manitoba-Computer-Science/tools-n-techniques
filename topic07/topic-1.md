You've been writing code, and hopefully doing OK.

But, uh, yeah. Gosh. Our code crashes a lot. Like a lot a lot. Sometimes this is
because we forgot to check for values we weren't expecting or didn't even think
could happen. Sometimes it's because our mental model of what our code does
isn't right. Sometimes it's because we inverted a conditional statement.

Regardless of the reason, trying to figure out *why* your code is crashing is an
important part of fixing your code.

We're going to take a look at what we're trying to accomplish when we're doing
debugging and different strategies for doing debugging. We'll also take a look
at a couple of specific tools, and try to get a handle on the keywords that are
used to describe how the tools are used.

::: outcomes

* [ ] Describe what debugging allows you to observe about a running program.
* [ ] Use log-based debugging to identify a problem with code.
* [ ] Use a visual debugger to set breakpoints, inspect values, step through a
  running program, and make observations about a program when it crashes.
* [ ] Use a command-line debugger to set breakpoints, inspect values, step
  through a running program, and make observations about a program when it
  crashes.
