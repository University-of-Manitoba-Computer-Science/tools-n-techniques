Summary
=======

Let's be honest: backing up stuff is boring. Well, it's boring right up until
you actually need the back up. And sometimes we don't *think* about backups
right up until we need them. This week is an opportunity to consider what you're
doing for back ups, and to give you an opportunity to *back up your stuff*.

Backing up isn't just making sure that you've got a copy of your files, it's
copying your files across devices and locations. It's also a choice of how you
do back ups in the first place: file-based or image-based.

Regardless of how you do back ups, restoring and verifying your back ups is an
essential part of confirming that you *actually have a back up* and not just a
bunch of [random bits and bytes].
