We've been focusing on getting operating systems and tools running in virtual
environments, and we've found a pretty reasonable use case for containers (we
got a fully configured `pandoc` on our own machines!).

You should now be able to:

::: outcomes

* [X] Install and configure virtual machine software.
* [X] Download and use a pre-installed operating system in a virtual machine
  software.
* [X] Run a command within a container.
* [X] Initialize a server in a publicly available cloud computing environment
  (e.g., AWS).
