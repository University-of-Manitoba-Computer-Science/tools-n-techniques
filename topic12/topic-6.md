Summary
=======

I (me, Franklin) think this is pretty cool! You should hopefully have a full 
Linux installation running in either a VM or on some real hardware. You should
have a better sense of what it takes to install a Linux distribution, and the 
kinds of choices you have about the software you're running on your machine.
You should also be able to install new software on your Linux install, and get
a web server up and running on your system.

::: outcomes

* [X] Choose a Linux distribution.
* [X] Install the Linux distribution either on your laptop or in a virtual machine.
* [X] Install packages using a package manager on the command line.
    * [X] Install packages using a GUI package manager.
* [X] Configure and run a web server.

:::

You should now be able to start working on your assignment!
