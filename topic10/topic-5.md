When you're developing code outside of your academic career (and even within
your academic career), you're going to be writing code that goes beyond a single
file. Different languages prefer to use different tools for handling building
your code and managing dependencies, and these tools can be very opinionated in
how they work (Maven) to not at all opinionated (`make`).

You should now be able to:

::: outcomes

* [X] Download and run a program that requires you to install dependencies.
* [X] Create a `Makefile` to accomplish a task (building software, running
  commands).
* [X] Create a new empty software project that includes a build and dependency
  management tool.
    * [X] Add and use a new dependency in a software project.
