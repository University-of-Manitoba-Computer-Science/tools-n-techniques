Summary
=======

This has been a bit of a whirlwind through some topics related to running
programs on Linux or UNIX-like systems, with us learning a little bit about
things that apply to *all* programs (how and where they get input, and how and
where they send output).

Depending on the path you take through CS, you may eventually learn about the
underlying mechanisms of how this all works (maybe) in an operating systems
course, specifically about how an operating system (OS) represents "processes"
(running programs) as a data structure, and how the OS keeps track of files that
a process has open (`STDIN`, `STDOUT`, and `STDERR` are all special
file-like-things&trade;; neat :camera:).

You've also seen how to take the commands you've been running on the command
line and keep them in a *script* so that you can quickly re-run them. While this
isn't a programming course, shells are full-featured programming languages. 

You should now be able to:

::: outcomes

* [X] Redirect the output from a program to a file.
* [X] Redirect a file to be the input for a program.
* [X] Send data between programs using a pipe.
* [X] Write and run shell scripts to repeat complex tasks.

Now you should be ready to start working on the assignment this week!
