At this point you're pretty familiar with using the command line.

While there's a whole world of things you can still learn about using the
command line, and more command line tools than you can imagine to learn about
(which sometimes themselves contain entire programming languages!), you've
learned and demonstrated a lot! :tada:

In this unit we're going to begin automating interactions with our shell
and begin to write shell "scripts": a *list* of commands that our shell will
run for us instead of having to type all the commands in one at a time.

::: outcomes

* [ ] Write and run shell scripts to repeat complex tasks.
* [ ] Use command-line arguments in a shell script.
* [ ] Use loops, conditional statements, and variables in a shell script.
    * [ ] Use "globs" in a shell script to apply operations to files.
* [ ] Apply strategies to debug shell scripts.
